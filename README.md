# Eye-Tracker-using-phone-front-camera
Distraction while driving reduce the drivers abilities of vehicle control, natural reﬂex, recognition and perception. Such diminished vigilance level of drivers cause accident and pose severe threat to mankind and society. Therefore it is appropriate to integrate driver assistance system that can detect vigilance level of drivers .Our proposal is not only to check the distraction and alert but also to give the virtual assistance to act on their accidental situations. Our objective is real time eye detection and tracking method that works under variable and realistic lighting conditions. As extra camera fittings are quite expensive and not affordable by everyone and since in our ecosystem mobile phone plays a major role, hence a phone camera is being used for the real-time acquisition of a driver’s eye images and the software implementation for monitoring eye.
